# üëã Hello, I'm Christina Loiacono!

I‚Äôm a Full Stack Software Engineer from New York City. I have 7 years of experience in textile design, and 2 years in web development including 7 months of professional experience. Recently, I was a Backend Engineering Intern on the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Team at The New York Times. Prior to that, I was an Assistant Coach at Pursuit for 4 months. I am also a recent graduate of Pursuit, an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate in NYC, where I learned Full Stack Web Development in JavaScript and the PERN Stack.

I became a software engineer because from a young age, I've always loved using computers to bring my ideas to life, whether by creating digital art or developing my own newsletters. Throughout my career, I‚Äôve demonstrated a passion for problem solving, paying close attention to details, and being curious to learn new things. Currently I'm focusing my passion into building innovative solutions that make a difference! I enjoy taking on complex problems, working collaboratively, and exploring new technologies.

## üî• What I‚Äôm Currently Working On
- Expanding my portfolio with full-stack web applications, focusing on real-world solutions.
- Contributing to open-source projects to improve my technical skills, give back to the community, and collaborate with other developers through GitHub.
- Exploring new technologies in frontend and backend development, including TypeScript.
