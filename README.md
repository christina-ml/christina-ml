### Hello!
I’m Christina, a Full Stack Software Engineer from New York City. Currently I am a recent graduate of Pursuit, an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate.

I became a software engineer because I have always enjoyed using computers from a young age to create things such as artwork and my own newsletters. I have a passion for problem solving, working on puzzles, paying close attention to details, and being curious to learn new things each day. Today I am using my knowledge that I’ve learned from Pursuit to turn code into full stack web applications. I believe I can make a difference and become a leader in tech by strengthening and building upon my skills as well as learning new and exciting technologies as they arise in a fast-growing industry.

Open to all opportunities: Full-time, Apprenticeships, Volunteer Opportunities, Open Source Projects!
